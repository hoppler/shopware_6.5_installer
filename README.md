Shopware Installer Script Installation:

Why is the installer script valuable:

1. Easy Installation:
   The Shopware installer script automates the installation process and simplifies the installation of Shopware 6.5 and subsequent versions. It is particularly useful for users without in-depth technical knowledge.

2. Error Avoidance:
   The script reduces the likelihood of errors during installation as it includes predefined steps and configurations necessary for a smooth installation.

3. Time-saving:
   By automating the installation process, the script saves time and effort. Users can focus on other tasks while the script performs the installation.

4. User-Friendly:
   The script features a user-friendly interface that allows users to select desired options and track the progress of the installation.

The installer script consists of two parts because the Shopware installation files can no longer be downloaded as a ZIP file. The script interacts with the Shopware installation process by downloading the necessary files and executing the installation steps. An active internet connection is required during the installation.

After the completion of the first part of the installation, a corresponding notification message will appear, containing further instructions. These instructions should be carefully followed to initiate the second part of the installation. The second part of the script executes the necessary steps to complete the installation of Shopware 6.5.

Once the second part of the installation is successfully completed, another message will appear, informing the user that the final installation of Shopware 6.5 can be initiated. At this point, Shopware is ready for use, and further configuration steps can be performed.

Through this two-stage installation, the script enables a seamless and efficient installation of Shopware 6.5. It guides the user throughout the process and provides clear instructions to successfully complete the installation. Please note that an active internet connection is required for the smooth execution of the installation.
